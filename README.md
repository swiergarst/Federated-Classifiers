# Federated-Classifiers
A collection of the federated classifier implementations which I build during my master thesis.
Specifically, the following classifiers can be found:

- Linear classifiers: [Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regressor](https://github.com/swiergarst/federatedLin)
- Neural Networks: [federated Fully Connected and Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/swiergarst/federatedNN)
- Decision trees: [Gradient Boosting Decision Trees](https://github.com/swiergarst/federatedDT)
